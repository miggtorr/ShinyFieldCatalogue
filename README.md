# ShinyFieldCatalogue
A macOS app to Count, Track, and Catalogue your Pokémon Shiny Hunt

### AI Disclosure: 
This project began with me learning how to use some of the coding features in the ChatGPT workspace provided by my employer. Thus, I used AI to write a significant portion of the code. 
The code was tested, tweaked, and debugged by hand by a real human (me) on a handful of real MacBooks.

# OS Requirements

This app has been tested on **macOS 14 Sonoma** and **macOS 26 Tahoe**. 
It will not run on Windows or Linux. Sorry!


# Installation & Running the App

## Installation

To install the app, open up the DMG and drag the app into your /Applications folder.

## Running the App

I am not an official Apple Developer, so this app is not "signed" or "notarized." 
This means that your system will complain that it "could contain malware."

If you are getting this from my (miggtorr) GitHub, there is no malware, lol. I will try to get an Apple Developer Account soon so I can sign my apps. :)

In any case, TO BE ABLE TO USE THE APP, you must open **Terminal** and--as an admin user--type:

`sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Shiny Field Catalogue.app"`

Then launch the app and it should run fine. :)

## Uninstalling the App

To uninstall the app you can just drag it to the trash. 
There are also config files that save to `/Users/[yourUsername]/Library/Application Support/Shiny Field Catalogue/`. 
Delete the "Shiny Field Catalogue" folder there and you're all set!
