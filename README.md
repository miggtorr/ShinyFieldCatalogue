# ShinyFieldCatalogue
A macOS app to Count, Track, and Catalogue your Pokémon Shiny Hunt

### AI Disclosure: 
This project began with me learning how to use some of the coding features in the ChatGPT workspace provided by my employer. Thus, I used AI to write a significant portion of the code. 
The code was tested, tweaked, and debugged by hand by a real human (me) on a handful of real MacBooks.

# OS Requirements
